# Energy Production Forecasting

Time Series Forecasts for Energy Production using LSTM-based RNNs.

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting energy production using time series data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The model is trained to predict future energy outputs based on historical data.

## Repository Contents

- `Production_Forecast.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
- `energy_produce_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkshadK7/Production_Forecasting.git
   cd Production_Forecasting
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Production_Forecast.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Open the `Production_Forecast.ipynb` notebook.
- Follow the steps outlined to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.
- Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different model architectures or parameters.

## Results

The model's performance metrics and visualizations of the predictions versus actual energy production are provided in the notebook. These insights can help in understanding the model's accuracy and areas for improvement.
